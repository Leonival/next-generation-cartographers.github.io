      <p class="teaser">
        Our group aims at creating <em>the</em> safe space for the next
        generation of scientists, professionals and enthusiasts in the field of
        cartography. A space to share work, find inspiration and connect with
        fellows.

      <p>
        The Next Generation Cartographers initiative (NGC) aims to support
        cartographers in the early stages of their career, both in academic and
        professional contexts. The initiative seeks to provide opportunities for
        mutual support and exchange, and to raise awareness for the needs and
        demands of next generation cartographers within the field of cartography
        and its established institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We consider “next generation cartographers” to include students towards
        the later stages of their education as well as young professionals,
        academics and cartography enthusiasts. More senior academics and
        professionals are also very welcome if they want to promote the
        interests of the next generation and support them as mentors or
        advisors.

      </p>
      <p>
        We consider “next generation cartographers” to include students towards
        the later stages of their education as well as young professionals,
        early career academics, and map enthusiasts; more senior academics and
        professionals are also very welcome if they want to promote the

      <details>
        <summary>Details</summary>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Establish opportunities for the NGC community to meet and share
            knowledge in a peer-to-peer fashion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support the career development of young professionals in the field
            and promote the needs and demands of the next generation within
            cartographic institutions, both on the local and global level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Raise awareness towards practices of exclusion, discrimination, and
            colonialism that have historically shaped our field and its
            institutions, by promoting critical, feminist, and solidary
            approaches to cartography and its institutional representation, as
            formulated by a global community of young scholars and
            professionals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actively reach out to demographics that are underrepresented in our
            field and its institutions, both on the local and global level, to
            join the NGC initiative.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
          The basis of the group's operation are the values of inclusiveness,
          diversity, and openness. NGC is a network and a safe space based on
          mutual trust and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          A code of conduct shall be developed that promotes these values and
          also allows for a wide range of opinions, views, and approaches to
          have a voice in the conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initiative is seeking to achieve this vision with the following
